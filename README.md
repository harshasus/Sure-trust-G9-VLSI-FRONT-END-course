Introduction to The SURE TRUST
The SURE TRUST is born to enhance the employability of educated
unemployed rural youth. It is observed that there is a wide gap between the skills
acquired by students from the academic institutions and the skills required by
the industry to employ them. Employability enhancement is done through
giving one on one training in emerging technologies, completely through online
mode.
The mission of the SURE TRUST is to bridge the gap between the skills
acquired and the skills required by training them in the most emerging
technologies such as Cyber Security(CS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Python
Program, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Data Science & data
analytics block chain Technology, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Project
Management, Excel for Business Application, Statistical tools & Applications,
Spoken English and Business Communication etc., that will enhance their
employability. After completion of four months training in the course, the
trainees will get live projects from industries as internship activity to get
experience in applying to real time situation what they have learnt during the
course. These projects will give them hands on experience which is much
sought after by the prospective industry employing them. Currently students
from all over India are enrolling for various courses offered by the SURE
TRUST.
The SURE TRUST offers every course free of cost with no financial
burden of any kind to students. This initiative is purely a service-oriented one
aiming to guide the rural youth who are educated but unemployed due to lack
of upgradation in their skill sets. The birth of SURE TRUST is a God given
boon to rural youth who could reach great heights either in employment or in
entrepreneurship once they receive the training offered followed by the
company internship. Many companies are coming forward to join their hands
with us by offering internship projects to hand hold and lead the rural youth in
their career settlement.
